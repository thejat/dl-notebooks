    "   -  Build a  Markov (n-gram) language model.\n",
    "   -  Change the output and the model appropriately in _[Simple Sentiment Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis)_ (also available [here](https://github.com/thejat/dl-notebooks/blob/master/examples/Seq2Seq_RNN_Simple_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb) where the imports have been slightly modified) to build an LSTM based language model. Plot the training performance as a function of epochs/iterations.\n",
