    "## Frequently Asked Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Project Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can we use pre-trained models?**\n",
    "> **A:** Yes! Transfer learning is strongly encouraged. Document what pre-trained model you use, why you chose it, and how you adapted it for your task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How much code should be original?**\n",
    "> **A:** Focus on adaptation and experimentation rather than writing everything from scratch. Using library functions and pre-built components is fine and expected. However, copying entire solutions without understanding or modification is not acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can we change topics after the intermediate submission?**\n",
    "> **A:** Consult with the instructor. Minor pivots are usually acceptable if well-justified. Major changes may require approval and could affect your intermediate grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What if our results are poor?**\n",
    "> **A:** Negative results with good analysis are valuable! Focus on:\n",
    "> - Understanding *why* the approach didn't work\n",
    "> - What you learned from the experience\n",
    "> - What you would try differently given more time\n",
    "> - Proper documentation of your experimental process\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can we create our own dataset?**\n",
    "> **A:** Yes, but ensure you have enough samples and the labeling is consistent. Document your data collection process thoroughly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What if our dataset is too large to submit?**\n",
    "> **A:** Submit a representative sample and provide clear instructions (and scripts if needed) to obtain the full dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can we use datasets from Kaggle competitions?**\n",
    "> **A:** Yes, but make sure your project goes beyond just running the competition baseline. Add your own analysis, experiments, and insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Teamwork\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How should we split work for grading?**\n",
    "> **A:** Include a contribution statement in your report. While tasks may be divided, all members should understand all parts of the project and be able to answer questions about any aspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What if a team member isn't contributing?**\n",
    "> **A:** Address issues early through direct communication. If problems persist, speak with the instructor before the final deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Technical Aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Do we need GPU access?**\n",
    "> **A:** For most projects, Google Colab's free GPU tier is sufficient. Plan your experiments to work within these constraints. For larger needs, consider Colab Pro or cloud credits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What deep learning framework should we use?**\n",
    "> **A:** PyTorch and TensorFlow/Keras are both acceptable. Use what you're most comfortable with or what has better support for your specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How many experiments should we run?**\n",
    "> **A:** Quality over quantity. At minimum:\n",
    "> - 1+ simple baseline(s)\n",
    "> - 1 main deep learning approach\n",
    "> - 2-3 variations or ablations\n",
    "> Document all experiments, including unsuccessful ones."
