    "## 2. Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this class is to cover a subset of advanced machine learning techniques, after students have seen the basics of data mining (such as in IDS 572) and machine learning (such as in IDS 575). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly, we will cover topics spanning **deep learning and reinforcement learning**. In particular, we will study popular deep learning architectures, their design choices and how they are trained. This will be motivated by business applications dealing with image, text and tabular data. Finally, we will look at online and reinforcement learning frameworks and their role in sequential decision making settings such as retail.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tentative list of topics is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Backpropagation and feed forward neural networks\n",
    " - Convolutional networks (CNNs)\n",
    " - Recurrent networks and Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs)\n",
    " - Attention mechanism and transformers (BERT, GPT-3)\n",
    " - Variational autoencoders (VAEs)\n",
    " - Generative adversarial networks (GANs)\n",
    " - Large Language Models (LLMs): training, inference and applications\n",
    " - Deep reinforcement learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN)\n",
    " - Deep learning design choices such as optimizers (Adam, RMSprop), nonlinearities, embeddings, attention, dropout, batch normalization etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also discuss aspects of **AI ethics, fairness, accountability, transparency and sustainability** in this course. ML systems are being adopted in a growing number of contexts, fueled by big data. These systems filter, sort, score, recommend, personalize, and otherwise shape human experience, increasingly making or informing decisions with major impact on access to, e.g., credit, insurance, healthcare, parole, social security, and immigration. Although these systems may bring myriad benefits, they also contain inherent risks, such as codifying and entrenching biases; reducing accountability, and hindering due process; they also increase the information asymmetry between individuals whose data feed into these systems and big players capable of inferring potentially relevant information. Under the *economic-social* intersection of sustainability (social: standard of living, education, community, equal opportunity; economic: profit, cost saving, economic growth), we will revisit how DL models and related ML systems could be designed that tackle the aforementioned challenges while providing value."
